## üåü **What is TejOCR?**

TejOCR is a simple add-on for LibreOffice Writer that can **read text from images** and **type it into your document automatically**. 

Think of it as having a smart assistant that can look at a picture with text (like a screenshot, photo of a page, or scanned document) and copy all the words into your document so you don't have to type them manually.

### **What it can do:**
- ‚úÖ Read text from image files (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Read text from images already in your document  
- ‚úÖ Automatically insert the recognized text where you want it
- ‚úÖ Work with many different languages
- ‚úÖ Handle different types of text (printed, handwritten, computer screenshots)
